The Game of Life is a simulation originally conceived by the British mathematician J. H. Conway in 1970 and
popularized by Martin Gardner in his Scientific American column. The game models the life cycle of bacteria using
a two-dimensional grid of cells. Given an initial pattern, the game simulates the birth and death of future
generations of cells using a set of simple rules. In this assignment you will implement a simplified version of
Conway's simulation and a basic user interface for watching the bacteria grow over time.
