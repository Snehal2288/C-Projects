A word ladder is a connection from one word to another formed by changing one letter at a time with the
constraint that at each step the sequence of letters still forms a valid word. For example, here is a word ladder
connecting the word "code" to the word "data". Each changed letter is underlined as an illustration:
code  cade  cate  date  data

Ngram is program that reads an input file and uses it to build a large data structure of word groups called "Ngrams" as a basis for randomly generating
new text that sounds like it came from the same author as that file.
